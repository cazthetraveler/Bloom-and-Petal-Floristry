# Bloom & Petal Floristry

## UI Design and MERN Stack Project

## Description

This is a UI Design project to showcase my skills as a graphic designer and web developer. This project is made using the MERN Stack.

Bloom & Petal Floristry is a flower-based business, getting all sorts of flowers and plants to you for whatever event you can think of!

## Usage

A user can create an account using a unique email address and be able to log on to their account. Once logged on, a user can then be able to access their shopping cart and add items to it. Items can also be removed from user's cart.

An admin user has special actions, like the ability to add, edit and delete categories and items from the admin page.

## Credits

This website is basically a redo of a [group project](https://github.com/cazthetraveler/Hobby-E-Commerce) that was made alongside [Drew Casas](https://github.com/drewhouses) and [Evan Rice](https://github.com/FoundEven). Even though there are some changes and more additions such as posting items from the website directly or reworking the shopping cart, I would still like to credit them as a lot of code and design is inspired from this group project we worked on together.
